A hard journey that made me who i am .[[Never Give up]]

Even though i am still a dust i have seen progress in me it does not matter if any other had  noticed it or not. 

The computer science Journey it all started from liking how technology work, seeing some cool stuff that had made progress and a dream of owning one cool gadget . 

Once i had a samsung duos phone in my childhood and my big brother just came from his job from mumbai i irritated him alot asking silly questions about technology so one day i thought of changing the Operating System of my samsung phone and he agreed for it and helped me alot for that but changing the Operating System didn't go well , but it gave me some inspiration of learning more about Operating System, how it interacts with the hardware and many more things.

So the Journey continues ,
